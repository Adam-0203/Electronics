# ALU Project ‚ö°

This project is an implementation of an **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/).  
It is composed of different logic modules (addition, subtraction, AND, OR) combined to form a working ALU.

## Components

Each fundamental operation was built separately. You can open and explore them in Tinkercad using the links below:

## Complete ALU

Once the components were designed and tested individually, they were combined into a single **ALU circuit**:

## How to Use
1. Click on any of the links above to open the corresponding circuit in Tinkercad.
2. Click **"Simulate"** in Tinkercad to run the circuit.
3. For the ALU:
   - Select the desired operation input.
   - Provide binary inputs.
   - Observe the result on the output pins/LEDs.
